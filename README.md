# Dark Souls Item Randomizer

Instructions:

* (PTDE Only) Unpack your Dark Souls archive files using UnpackDarkSoulsForModding, which can be found [here](https://github.com/HotPocketRemix/UnpackDarkSoulsForModding).
* Download `DarkSoulsItemRandomizer.exe`, and place it in your Dark Souls directory, where DARKSOULS.exe (PTDE) or DarkSoulsRemastered.exe (DS1R) are.
* Run the Item Randomizer and select your options. When you are ready to randomize your items, click the Export button to automatically write the modified item
configuration to `GameParam.parambnd` or `GameParam.parambnd.dcx`, depending on the game version. A backup copy will be created if it does not already exist. 
A directory with the current date/time stamp will be created containing information about the item distribution, including a cheatsheet.
* If you want to inspect a certain item distribution, but not modify the actual game files, you can instead input a seed and click the "Write Seed Info" button
to generate the same type of folder as above, without modifying the current item distribution. Note that you *must* input a seed for this to work.

To restore the default item distribution:

* Check that `GameParam.parambnd[.dcx].bak` exists in `\param\GameParam`.
* Delete `GameParam.parambnd[.dcx]` from `\param\GameParam`.
* Re-name `GameParam.parambnd[.dcx].bak` to `GameParam.parambnd[.dcx]`.

(For PTDE, ignore the `[.dcx]` portion. For DS1R, ignore just the `[` and `]`.)


The data/time-stamped directory that is generated contains 5 files:

* `ItemLotParam.param`, `ShopLineupParam.param` and `CharaInitParam.param`. These files are the actual subfiles that are being modified in `GameParam.parambnd` and are
provided for those who wish to inspect them in a .param editor.
* `cheatsheet.txt` contains a list of every location that items can be shuffled to -- with a short description of the location -- and a list of each
shuffled item that is placed at each location. Since NPC drop tables are also shuffled, they are included at the end of the cheatsheet.
* `hintsheet.txt` contains a list of each key item in the game, together with the area that it is located in. If you are stuck, you can use the
hint sheet to give an idea of where a key item is before resorting to using the cheatsheet to find its exact location.
* `seed_info.txt` contains the settings and seed used in the Item Randomizer to produce the item distribution. If you forget the seed/setting you used or want to share the
settings with others, this file has the exact information needed.



**Randomizer Settings**:

The following is a brief description of each of the Item Randomizer's settings:

Difficulty: Determines how much the Randomizer is biased against you. The more unfair it is, the more it attempts to hide desirable items (good weapons, lighter armor, keys)
in harder-to-reach or less well-known locations.

Key Placement: Determines how the Randomizer places keys. On "Not Shuffled", key items are in their usual locations. On "Shuffled", key items are placed in any locations, provided they do
not lead to a softlock where not all areas can be accessed before defeating Gwyn. On "Race Mode", key items are placed in a restricted set of locations, so that not every location needs
to be checked for a key. The list of locations consists of boss drops, in chests, dropped by Black Knights, and in locations where key items (including embers) are normally.
This README contains a full list of all the Race Mode locations at the end. On "Race Mode +", key items are placed as in Race Mode, but skips and glitches
are taken into account. This README contains a list of these skips and glitches that you may need to use.

Soul Items: Determines how the Randomizer treats soul consumables. On "Shuffled", they are treated like any other item. On "Replaced", they are replaced with a random consumable before being shuffled.
This reduces the number of soul consumables in the game, but can make item pickups more interesting, as otherwise you receive many soul consumables, which some players find boring.
On "Transposed", each boss soul has a 75% chance to be replaced by a corresponding boss weapon.

Starting Items: Determines what pool of weapons/shields the Randomizer draw from when choosing the player's starting left-hand and right-hand items.

Fashion Souls: If active, the many armor sets in game are split up, and each piece is placed separately.

Laundromat Mixup: If active, most human NPCs will wear random armor instead of their usual sets. If Fashion Souls is not active, NPCs will wear randomly chosen full sets of armor. 
If Fashion Souls is active, NPCs will wear independently chosen random pieces of armor.

Senile Gwynevere: If active, the Lordvessel will be shuffled like other key items, and Gwynevere will give the player a different item in place of the Lordvessel. Not compatible with not shuffling keys.

Senile Primordial Serpents: If active, the four Lord Souls will be shuffled like other key items. Not compatible with not shuffling keys.

Eager Smiths: If active, weapons capable of upgrading along the various ember paths (Chaos, Magic, Divine, etc.) have a 25% chance of dropping as a +0 version of one of these paths. A bit of an easier setting, but will allow for more diversity of viable weapons across playthroughs.
